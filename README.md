This is the data base used in paper "Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose"

No_VE_reduction = are the files with no reduction in Vaccine Efficacy (VE) due to delay
VE_reduction = are the files with reduction in VE due to delay.

In the subfolders, the number at the end of the folder's name represents the delay between first and second doses.

The files inside are divided by age groups (1-6, and all), and by outcomes (infection = lat,non-icu hospitalization=hos, icu hospitalization = icu, and deaths = ded)

Those files have a heading and the first column display the simulation day.
