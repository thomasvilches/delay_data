This is the data base used in paper "Evaluation of COVID-19 vaccination strategies with a delayed second dose"

No_VE_reduction = are the files with no reduction in Vaccine Efficacy (VE) due to delay
VE_reduction = are the files with reduction in VE due to delay.

In the subfolders "results" are divided in 10, 20 and 30% initial herd immunity. The simulated vaccine is either pfizer or moderna, considering the "mean", "upper" and "lower" values of vaccine efficacy of each one. The number at the end of the folder's name represents the delay between first and second doses.

The files "simlevel" inside the folders are divided by age groups (1-6, and all), and by outcomes (infection = lat,non-icu hospitalization=hos, icu hospitalization = icu, and deaths = ded)

Those files have a heading and the first column display the simulation day.

The simulated R0 can be found in the first column of the file R01.dat

Other files contains extra information that was not used in this work.
